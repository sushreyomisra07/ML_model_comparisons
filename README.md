# ML_model_comparisons
This repository consists of four files
1. Main_longterm.m
2. Main_shortterm.m
3. split_train_test.m
4. load_data_from_csv.m

In order to compare different models for short term unusability, run the Main_shortterm.m file.
In order to compare different models for long term unusability, run the Main_longterm.m file.

The other two are helper functions.

Note that there may be some mistake in how the long term and short term unusability buildings are labeled. Please check lines 23-34 and make changes accordingly.
